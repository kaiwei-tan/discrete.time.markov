# discrete.time.markov

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Applies the discrete time Markov model (Markov chain) to analyze data
(both text and non-text) by computing probabilities of transitions
between different states.

Inspired by my Stochastic Models in Management module, as well as my
Honors Dissertation, as part of my coursework in the National University
of Singapore (NUS) Business School.

## Installation

You can install the released version of discrete.time.markov from my
[GitHub](https://github.com/kaiwei-tan/discrete.time.markov) with:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("kaiwei-tan/discrete.time.markov")
```

## Functionality

This package contains the following functions:

-   `get.transitions`: creates dataframe of all state transition
    probabilities
-   `get.transitions.text`: text version of `get.transitions`
-   `get.transition.matrix`: creates transition probability matrix
-   `get.transition.matrix.text`: text version of
    `get.transition.matrix`
-   `get.steady.state`: calculates steady-state / long-run probabilities
    of all states

## Examples

This is a basic example, where we generate a random sequence of states
and calculate their transition probabilities:

``` r
library(discrete.time.markov)

# Generate random sequence of states
set.seed(57)
states <- sample(c('up', 'down', 'same'), 10000, replace=TRUE)

# Create transition probability matrix
get.transition.matrix(states, option='prob', output_type='matrix')
#>           down      same        up
#> down 0.3348044 0.3309797 0.3342159
#> same 0.3324275 0.3324275 0.3351449
#> up   0.3524939 0.3302920 0.3172141
```

Here is another example involving text. Let each word in our example
sentence be considered as a state, and we calculate their transition
probabilities accordingly:

``` r
sentence <- 'the quick, brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'

# Function ignores mid-sentence punctuation i.e. the comma
# Create transition probability matrix
get.transition.matrix.text(sentence, 1, option='prob', output_type='matrix', punct='none')
#>       brown dog fox jumps lazy over quick the
#> brown     0   0   1     0  0.0    0   0.0   0
#> dog       0   1   0     0  0.0    0   0.0   0
#> fox       0   0   0     1  0.0    0   0.0   0
#> jumps     0   0   0     0  0.0    1   0.0   0
#> lazy      0   1   0     0  0.0    0   0.0   0
#> over      0   0   0     0  0.0    0   0.0   1
#> quick     1   0   0     0  0.0    0   0.0   0
#> the       0   0   0     0  0.5    0   0.5   0
```

Now letâ€™s see what happens when we consider two words in a state and
involve the period at the end (ignoring mid-sentence punctuation, each
symbol counts as a state regardless of the number of words considered as
a state).

``` r
# Create transition probability matrix
get.transition.matrix.text(sentence, 2, option='prob', output_type='matrix', punct='end')
#>             . brown fox fox jumps jumps over lazy dog over the quick brown
#> .           1         0         0          0        0        0           0
#> brown fox   0         0         1          0        0        0           0
#> fox jumps   0         0         0          1        0        0           0
#> jumps over  0         0         0          0        0        1           0
#> lazy dog    1         0         0          0        0        0           0
#> over the    0         0         0          0        0        0           0
#> quick brown 0         1         0          0        0        0           0
#> the lazy    0         0         0          0        1        0           0
#> the quick   0         0         0          0        0        0           1
#>             the lazy the quick
#> .                  0         0
#> brown fox          0         0
#> fox jumps          0         0
#> jumps over         0         0
#> lazy dog           0         0
#> over the           1         0
#> quick brown        0         0
#> the lazy           0         0
#> the quick          0         0
```

We can also use the output of `get.transitions.text` (for text data) or
`get.transitions` (for non-text), which return a dataframe of state
transitions and their probabilities, with to get a state transition
diagram:

``` r
library(magrittr)
library(igraph)

lyrics <- c('never gonna give you up', 'never gonna let you down')

# Create dataframe of state transitions and probabilities
lyrics_transitions <- get.transitions.text(lyrics, 1, option='prob', punct='none')
lyrics_transitions
#> # A tibble: 7 x 3
#>   start_state end_state  prob
#>   <chr>       <chr>     <dbl>
#> 1 give        you         1  
#> 2 gonna       give        0.5
#> 3 gonna       let         0.5
#> 4 let         you         1  
#> 5 never       gonna       1  
#> 6 you         down        0.5
#> 7 you         up          0.5

# Plot graph
igraph::graph_from_data_frame(lyrics_transitions) %>%
  plot(edge.label=lyrics_transitions$prob, vertex.color='white')
```
